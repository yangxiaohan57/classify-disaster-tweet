# MIDS 703 Fall 2020: Final Project 

## *This assignment is still being refined. Stay tuned for updates*

## Final Project Guidelines
The final projects will be a group assignment completed by teams (the same teams assigned in Michael's IDS 702 Modeling class). As a team, you will collaboratively tackle a challenging project with a deep dive into a more technical area of NLP. Your project can be
* Replicating or extending an existing NLP application or result
* Learning, Applying, and Presenting your use of advanced methods and tools (open source, tools not covered in class, cloud based tools)
* Learning an advanced theory from NLP not covered in class and presenting as a tutorial with examples

Your final submission will include
* A ~5 minute recorded presentation (.mp4). It should be compelling and engaging!
* A written report, included a description of the methods and data. 
* Detailed description of individual roles
* 360-degree peer evaluation

**Deadlines**
* Project Proposals Due: Monday, October 19
* Final Project Presentations: November 16
